#### 前言



```xml
<plugin>
   <groupId>org.basepom.maven</groupId>
   <artifactId>duplicate-finder-maven-plugin</artifactId>
   <version>1.2.1</version>
   <configuration>
       <useDefaultResourceIgnoreList>true</useDefaultResourceIgnoreList>
       <!-- 忽略不检查的资源 -->
       <ignoredResourcePatterns>
           <ignoredResourcePattern>.*\.txt</ignoredResourcePattern>
           <ignoredResourcePattern>.*\.properties</ignoredResourcePattern>
           <ignoredResourcePattern>.*\.xml</ignoredResourcePattern>
       </ignoredResourcePatterns>
       <!-- fail fast after find duplicate class -->
       <!--<failBuildInCaseOfConflict>true</failBuildInCaseOfConflict>-->
       <ignoredDependencies>
           <!-- 不需要校验的依赖项 -->
           <!--<dependency>-->
               <!--<groupId>com.sm.uc</groupId>-->
               <!--<artifactId>uc-rpc</artifactId>-->
           <!--</dependency>-->
       </ignoredDependencies>
   </configuration>
   <executions>
       <execution>
           <phase>package</phase>
           <goals>
               <goal>check</goal>
           </goals>
       </execution>
   </executions>
</plugin>
```


#### Maven Release plugin

##### 使用示例

```xml
<project>
  ...
  <scm>
    <developerConnection>scm:svn:https://svn.mycompany.com/repos/myapplication/trunk/mycomponent/</developerConnection>
    <!-- developerConnection:  -->
  </scm>

  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
        <artifactId>maven-release-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>2.5.3</version>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
    ...
  </build>
  ...
</project>
```

| Goal | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| release:branch | Branch a project in SCM, using the same steps as the release:prepare goal, creating a branch instead of a tag. For more info see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/branch.html. |
| release:clean |	Clean up after a release preparation. This is done automatically after a successful release:perform, so is best served for cleaning up a failed or abandoned release, or a dry run. Note that only the working copy is cleaned up, no previous steps are rolled back. For more info see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/clean-release.html. |
| release:help |	Display help information on maven-release-plugin. Call mvn release:help -Ddetail=true -Dgoal=<goal-name> to display parameter details. |
| release:perform |	Perform a release from SCM, either from a specified tag, or the tag representing the previous release in the working copy created by release:prepare. For more info see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/perform-release.html. |
| release:prepare |	Prepare for a release in SCM. Steps through several phases to ensure the POM is ready to be released and then prepares SCM to eventually contain a tagged version of the release and a record in the local copy of the parameters used. This can be followed by a call to |  
| release:perform. For more info see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/prepare-release.html. |
| release:prepare-with-pom |	Prepare for a release in SCM, fully resolving dependencies for the purpose of producing a "release POM". |
| release:rollback |	Rollback changes made by a previous release. This requires that the previous release descriptor release.properties is still available in the local working copy. For more info see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/rollback-release.html. |
| release:stage |	Perform a release from SCM to a staging repository. If no goals are given, these default to deploy or deploy site:stage-deploy, if the project has a <distributionManagement>/<site> element. If the goals contain site-deploy or site:deploy, these are overridden with site:stage-deploy. |
| release:update-versions |	Update the POM versions for a project. This performs the normal version updates of the release:prepare goal without making other modifications to the SCM such as tagging. For more info see http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/examples/update-versions.html. |
